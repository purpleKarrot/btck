BtcK Documentation
==================

BtcK is a proof-of-concept interface for the Bitcoin Kernel library. Its primary
goal is to provide consistent APIs across multiple programming languages, while
striving to make each API idiomatic for its target language. This means that
developers can expect the interface to follow the conventions and best practices
of the language they are using, resulting in a more natural and intuitive
experience.
